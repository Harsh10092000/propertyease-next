                <b>5.6 Auto-renewal. </b>Your Propertyease.in subscription will
                be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the
                same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at
                the then-current non-promotional subscription rate. If you
                resign, you may use your subscription until the end of your
                then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be
                renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won't
                be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the
                subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.{" "}

                <b>5.7 Reaffirmation of Authorization.</b> Your non-termination
                or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Propertyease.in
                is authorized to charge your Payment Method. Propertyease.in may
                submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for
                such charges. This does not waive Propertyease.in right to seek
                payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in
                advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when
                you initially subscribed to the Service.

                <b>5.8 Promotions.</b> Any promotion that provides
                subscriber-level access to the Service must be used within the
                specified time of the promotion. You must cancel your
                subscription 10 days prior to the next payment due date in order
                to avoid being charged a subscription fee. If you cancel prior
                to the end of the promotion period and are inadvertently charged
                for a subscription, please contact Customer Service.

                <b>5.9 Cancellation.</b> Either party may elect to cancel this
                agreement at any time, providing the following: Propertyease.in
                may elect to terminate this agreement at any time if it is
                deemed warranted due to payment default. Propertyease.in will
                notify Subscriber of such intent and provide a grace period of
                not less than 10 days for Subscriber to have the opportunity to
                remedy the situation. In the event that Subscriber fails to
                remedy the situation within the allotted time frame,
                Propertyease.in shall reserve the right to remove the listing
                created for Subscriber from the database. In the event that
                Subscriber wishes to terminate this agreement, the cancellation
                procedure must be initiated no later than 10 days prior to the
                end of their current term through their client login which can
                be received via our customer service department Monday through
                Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. The Customer Service must
                assist Subscriber through the cancellation process and will send
                an e-mail containing a unique URL(link) that can be accessed
                only for 24 hours. That URL(link) will open a special
                cancellation page attached to Subscriber's account. If
                Subscriber completes the cancellation procedure, services will
                be discontinued at the end of the billing period. Failure to
                take any action will automatically prolong the contract and
                Subscriber will be responsible for the upcoming periodic charge
                and will not be entitled to a refund of any portion thereof.
